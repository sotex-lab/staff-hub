# Pre-commit Hooks

The `precommit` folder contains custom pre-commit hooks for this repository. Pre-commit hooks are scripts that run before each commit to ensure that the committed code meets certain criteria.

## Custom Hooks

Inside this folder, you may find various bash scripts, Python scripts, or any other scripts that are executed as pre-commit hooks. These hooks help enforce code quality, formatting standards, and other checks before changes are committed.

### Example Structure:

```bash
precommit/
│ check-formatting.sh
│ lint-python.py
│ custom-checks/
│ ...
```

## Integration with Pre-commit

The pre-commit hooks are integrated into the workflow using [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/), a framework for managing and maintaining multi-language pre-commit hooks.

To use these hooks, make sure you have pre-commit installed. You can install it by following the instructions in the [pre-commit documentation](https://pre-commit.com/#install).

## Configuration

In the root of the repository, you'll find a configuration file named `.pre-commit-config.yaml`. This file lists the pre-commit hooks and their configurations. When you run `pre-commit install`, it sets up the hooks as part of the Git commit process.

## Contributing to Hooks

If you have additional pre-commit hooks or improvements to existing ones, contributions are welcome. Feel free to submit a pull request with your changes.
