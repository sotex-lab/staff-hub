# Source Code (src) Folder

The `src` folder is the primary location for storing the source code of this repository. It is organized following a convention where each project resides in its own folder.

## Project Structure

To maintain a clear and organized codebase, consider organizing the projects within the `src` folder in a way that reflects the structure of the solution file (.sln). This helps developers easily locate and navigate through the code.

### Example Structure:

```bash
src/
│
├── ProjectA/
│ ├── Controllers/
│ ├── Models/
│ ├── Services/
│ └── ...
│
├── ProjectB/
│ ├── Views/
│ ├── Helpers/
│ └── ...
│
├── SharedUtilities/
│ ├── Logging/
│ ├── Utilities/
│ └── ...
│
└── ...
```

## Folder-Per-Project Convention

To keep things organized, it is recommended to have a separate folder for each project within the `src` directory. This structure ensures a clear separation of concerns and makes it easier to manage and understand the codebase.

## Contribution Guidelines

If you are contributing to an existing project or adding a new one, make sure to follow the established conventions for the `src` folder. Consistency in project structure enhances collaboration and makes it simpler for everyone to work with the code.
