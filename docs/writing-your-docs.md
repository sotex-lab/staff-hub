# Documentation Structure

The `docs` folder in this repository is dedicated to organizing and hosting documentation related to the codebase. It follows a structured approach to provide clear and comprehensive documentation.

## Organization

The documentation is organized into directories based on different aspects of the project. Each directory may contain relevant files, subdirectories, and additional resources. This structure helps users and contributors find information efficiently.

### Example Structure:

```bash
docs/
│ getting-started/
│ development/
│ api-reference/
│ ...
```

Feel free to explore the directories to find the information you need.

## GitHub Pages

We host our documentation using GitHub Pages, making it accessible at [https://sotex-lab.github.io/staff-hub/](https://sotex-lab.github.io/staff-hub/). GitHub Pages automatically updates with changes to the `docs` folder, providing an always up-to-date reference.
